# Pokemon Showdown DTL Bot
A bot for battling on Pokemon Showdown that uses Decision Tree Learning

## How it works
There are two parts to the AI - the spectating bot and the battling bot. The spectating bot is used to watch and record 
human gameplay so that it can learn what actions to take in various scenarios. To reduce complexity, it is trained to
work with one specific team. Once the spectating bot has acquired enough data, this data can be turned into a decision
tree for the battling bot to use when it battles.
